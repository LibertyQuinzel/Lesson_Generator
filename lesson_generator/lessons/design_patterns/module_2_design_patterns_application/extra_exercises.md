# Extra Exercises - Module 2: Applying Design Patterns

### Challenge 1: Identify Behavioral Patterns (Easy)
**Goal:** Identify three behavioral design patterns used in a common application (e.g., a messaging app).  
**Hints:** Look for patterns that manage communication between objects. Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Command.  
**Stretch Idea:** Research a fourth pattern not commonly found in messaging apps.

---

### Challenge 2: Implement the Observer Pattern (Medium)
**Goal:** Implement a simple Observer pattern in Python for a weather station simulation.  
**Hints:** Create `Subject` and `Observer` classes. The `Subject` should notify observers of changes in weather data.  
**Stretch Idea:** Add functionality to allow observers to unsubscribe from the subject.

---

### Challenge 3: Refactor Using Strategy Pattern (Medium)
**Goal:** Refactor a simple calculator program to use the Strategy design pattern for different operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).  
**Hints:** Define an interface for the strategy, then implement concrete classes for each operation.  
**Stretch Idea:** Allow dynamic switching of strategies at runtime based on user input.

---

### Challenge 4: Design Principles Application (Hard)
**Goal:** Analyze a given code snippet and identify violations of SOLID principles. Provide suggestions for improvement.  
**Hints:** Look for single responsibility violations, dependency inversions, and Liskov substitutions.  
**Stretch Idea:** Rewrite the code snippet to adhere to the SOLID principles effectively.

---

### Challenge 5: Real-World Use Case of Command Pattern (Hard)
**Goal:** Describe a real-world application that utilizes the Command pattern. Discuss its components and benefits.  
**Hints:** Consider applications like text editors or remote controls where actions can be queued or undone.  
**Stretch Idea:** Create a hypothetical scenario where the Command pattern could improve a process in your daily life.

---

### Challenge 6: Chain of Responsibility Implementation (Hard)
**Goal:** Implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern in a customer support ticketing system.  
**Hints:** Create handlers for different levels of support (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Manager). Each handler should decide whether to process the request or pass it along.  
**Stretch Idea:** Add logging functionality to track which handler processed each request.

---

### Challenge 7: Analyze and Design a State Pattern (Very Hard)
**Goal:** Design a state machine using the State pattern for a vending machine.  
**Hints:** Define states like Idle, Selecting, Dispensing, and OutOfStock. Each state should handle transitions to the next state.  
**Stretch Idea:** Implement a feature that allows the vending machine to accept different payment methods.

---

### Challenge 8: Compare Patterns (Very Hard)
**Goal:** Compare the Strategy and State patterns. Discuss similarities, differences, and use cases for each.  
**Hints:** Focus on their intent, structure, and how they manage behavior.  
**Stretch Idea:** Create a visual diagram to illustrate the differences and similarities between the two patterns.
