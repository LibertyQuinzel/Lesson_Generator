# Extra Exercises - Module 1: Introduction to Design Patterns

## Challenge 1: Identify Design Patterns (Easy)
**Goal:** Identify design patterns from given scenarios.  
**Hints:** Look for common problems and solutions in software design.  
**Stretch Idea:** Create your own scenario and identify the design pattern that fits.

---

## Challenge 2: Singleton Pattern Implementation (Easy)
**Goal:** Implement a basic Singleton class in your preferred language.  
**Hints:** Ensure the class has a private constructor and a static method for instance retrieval.  
**Stretch Idea:** Make your Singleton thread-safe.

---

## Challenge 3: Factory Method Pattern (Medium)
**Goal:** Create a simple factory method that generates different types of objects.  
**Hints:** Define an interface for the product and implement concrete classes.  
**Stretch Idea:** Add error handling for unsupported product types.

---

## Challenge 4: Adapter Pattern Example (Medium)
**Goal:** Implement an Adapter pattern to make two incompatible interfaces work together.  
**Hints:** Identify the two interfaces and create an adapter class that implements one and uses the other.  
**Stretch Idea:** Test your adapter with multiple client classes.

---

## Challenge 5: Observer Pattern Implementation (Hard)
**Goal:** Create an Observer pattern where multiple observers track changes in a subject.  
**Hints:** Define a Subject interface and Observer interface, then implement them.  
**Stretch Idea:** Add functionality to allow observers to unsubscribe.

---

## Challenge 6: Decorator Pattern Usage (Hard)
**Goal:** Implement the Decorator pattern to add new functionalities to a base class without altering its structure.  
**Hints:** Create a base component and multiple decorators that extend its functionality.  
**Stretch Idea:** Allow multiple decorators to be applied to a single component.

---

## Challenge 7: Composite Pattern Application (Hard)
**Goal:** Use the Composite pattern to create a tree structure of objects.  
**Hints:** Define a component interface, then create leaf and composite classes.  
**Stretch Idea:** Implement a method to calculate the total cost of all components in the tree.

---

## Challenge 8: Strategy Pattern Example (Hard)
**Goal:** Implement the Strategy pattern to allow a class to select an algorithm at runtime.  
**Hints:** Define a strategy interface and implement several concrete strategies.  
**Stretch Idea:** Add a context class that utilizes different strategies based on user input.
