Change the project so that:
1. The program, by default, reads the reference course folder, and generates the templates during
every run. 
2. The program takes the input of the number of modules in each lesson, along with the number of
lessons. If not given, it defaults to 5. 
3. Each of these modules have the same structure, as defined by the template generated.
4. The topic is given as a run time input, the program needs to firstly generate (using ai)
a list of topics to structure as modules. 
This includes the time it will take, what the goals are, and references for learning like real 
python learning modules, documentation links etc. Once that is done, it has to create the module
according to the template, based on these topics and one by one, fill in the content
i.e. (readme files, assignments, examples, exercises etc.)
5. Make sure that all of the content is ai generated, and the progress bar depicts a detailed 
list of the modules being generated, and are being generated.
6. Run the tests once the  course is generated. 


-----------------------------
7. fix the starter example content issue: errors.txt should be empty
8. input sanitation: snake case issue: just take inputs in the form of text within a string and 
don't mandate snake case. convert it to lower yourself.
9. difficulty variation add input: a flag with two difficulties -b for beginener, -i for intermediate
-a for advanced, and the difficulty of assigments generated should be there accordingly. 
10. fix the coverage: check the test coverage and add tests whenever needed to bring the coverage to
 more than 97%. 
11. pytest,pylint for the whole project: do linting and check for any 
12. red, green and blue phases: to be implemented
13. update the documentation: write the documentation for all the code in the lesson generator project
14. update the readme: make sure it's up to date.
